ENTOY100A-dcr-AAdel	CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON	protein two	in-frame stop codon exists 5' of stop position predicted by homology to reference [revised to 32..37 (stop shifted 8 nt)]
ENTOY100A-dcr-AAdel	INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START	protein two	alignment to homology model is a gap at 5' boundary [RF position 33]
ENTOY100A-dcr-AAdel	MUTATION_AT_START	protein two	expected start codon could not be identified [TGG starting at position 32 on + strand is not a valid start]
ENTOY100A-dcr-AAdel	UNEXPECTED_LENGTH	protein two	length of complete coding (CDS or mat_peptide) feature is not a multiple of 3 [14]
ENTOY100A-dcr-AAAdel	MUTATION_AT_END	protein one	expected stop codon could not be identified, first in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted stop position [58]
ENTOY100A-dcr-AAAdel	INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START	protein two	alignment to homology model is a gap at 5' boundary [RF position 33]
ENTOY100A-dcr-AAAdel	MUTATION_AT_END	protein two	expected stop codon could not be identified, first in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted stop position [58]
ENTOY100A-dcr-AAAdel	MUTATION_AT_START	protein two	expected start codon could not be identified [GGT starting at position 32 on + strand is not a valid start]

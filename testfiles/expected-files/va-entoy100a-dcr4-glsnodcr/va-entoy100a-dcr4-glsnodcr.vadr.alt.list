ENTOY100A-dcr-ins-Ains1	POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT	protein two	potential frameshift in CDS [nucleotide alignment of positions 33..34 (2 nt) on + strand are inconsistent with dominant frame (+2); inserts:34; deletes:none;]
ENTOY100A-dcr-ins-Ains1	MUTATION_AT_END	protein two	expected stop codon could not be identified, no in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted start codon
ENTOY100A-dcr-ins-Ains1	MUTATION_AT_START	protein two	expected start codon could not be identified [AAT starting at position 33 on + strand is not a valid start]
ENTOY100A-dcr-ins-Ains1	UNEXPECTED_LENGTH	protein two	length of complete coding (CDS or mat_peptide) feature is not a multiple of 3 [16]
ENTOY100A-dcr-ins-Tins1	CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON	protein three	in-frame stop codon exists 5' of stop position predicted by homology to reference [revised to 66..52 (stop shifted 1 nt)]
ENTOY100A-dcr-ins-Tins1	POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT	protein three	potential frameshift in CDS [nucleotide alignment of positions 53..51 (3 nt) on - strand are inconsistent with dominant frame (-1); inserts:53; deletes:none;]
ENTOY100A-dcr-ins-Tins1	UNEXPECTED_LENGTH	protein three	length of complete coding (CDS or mat_peptide) feature is not a multiple of 3 [16]

LC312762.1	INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION	nonstructural polyprotein	nucleotide-based search identifies CDS not identified in protein-based search
LC312762.1	MUTATION_AT_END	nonstructural polyprotein	expected stop codon could not be identified, predicted CDS stop by homology is invalid [AAA ending at position 15 on + strand is not a valid stop]
LC312762.1	PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM	RdRp	mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem

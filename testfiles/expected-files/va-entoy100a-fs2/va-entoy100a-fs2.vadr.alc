1     mutendcd  yes      MUTATION_AT_END                feature      3     3  expected stop codon could not be identified, predicted CDS stop by homology is invalid
2     mutendns  yes      MUTATION_AT_END                feature     11     8  expected stop codon could not be identified, no in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted start codon
3     mutendex  yes      MUTATION_AT_END                feature      4     4  expected stop codon could not be identified, first in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted stop position
4     unexleng  yes      UNEXPECTED_LENGTH              feature     28    16  length of complete coding (CDS or mat_peptide) feature is not a multiple of 3
5     cdsstopn  yes      CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON             feature      9     8  in-frame stop codon exists 5' of stop position predicted by homology to reference
6     fsthicft  yes      POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT_HIGH_CONF  feature     20    16  high confidence possible frameshift in CDS (frame not restored before end)
7     fsthicfi  yes      POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT_HIGH_CONF  feature      8     8  high confidence possible frameshift in CDS (frame restored before end)
8     peptrans  yes      PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM    feature     20    10  mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
9     pepadjcy  yes      PEPTIDE_ADJACENCY_PROBLEM      feature      2     2  predictions of two mat_peptides expected to be adjacent are not adjacent
10    indf5gap  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START    feature      2     2  alignment to homology model is a gap at 5' boundary
11    indf5lcn  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START    feature      1     1  alignment to homology model has low confidence at 5' boundary for feature that does not match a CDS
12    indf3gap  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END      feature      7     5  alignment to homology model is a gap at 3' boundary
13    indf3lcn  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END      feature      1     1  alignment to homology model has low confidence at 3' boundary for feature that does not match a CDS

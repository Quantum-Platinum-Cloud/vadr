NC_029646.1-N2	N_AT_CDS_END	nonstructural polyprotein	final nucleotide of CDS is an N [final 70 positions are Ns, final non-N is position 795]
NC_029646.1-N2	DELETION_OF_NT	nonstructural polyprotein	too large of a deletion in protein-based alignment [blastx predicted delete of length 45>27 starting at reference amino acid posn 330]
NC_029646.1-N2	PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM	p48	mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
NC_029646.1-N2	INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START	NTPase	alignment to homology model has low confidence at 5' boundary [0.50 < 0.60 (mat_peptide feature), RF position 995]
NC_029646.1-N2	PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM	NTPase	mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem

Additional note(s) to submitter:
ERROR: N_AT_CDS_END: (nonstructural polyprotein) final nucleotide of CDS is an N [final 70 positions are Ns, final non-N is position 795]
ERROR: DELETION_OF_NT: (nonstructural polyprotein) too large of a deletion in protein-based alignment [blastx predicted delete of length 45>27 starting at reference amino acid posn 330]
ERROR: PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM: (p48) mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
ERROR: INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START: (NTPase) alignment to homology model has low confidence at 5' boundary [0.50 < 0.60 (mat_peptide feature), RF position 995]
ERROR: PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM: (NTPase) mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem

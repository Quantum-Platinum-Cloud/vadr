## VADR installation using the `vadr-install.sh` script <a name="install"></a>

The file `vadr-install.sh` is an executable file for installing VADR
and its dependencies. That file is located online at github.
To install the latest version of VADR download this file:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncbi/vadr/master/vadr-install.sh

To download any specific release/version, for example version 1.0 download
the corresponding `vadr-install.sh` file for that release/version
(prior to version 1.0, the name of the installation script was
`install.sh`, not `vadr-install.sh`):

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncbi/vadr/1.0/vadr-install.sh

Copy the `vadr-install.sh` file into the directory in which you want
to install VADR. A good name for that directory is
`vadr-install-dir`. Then move into that directory and run one of the
following two commands depending on whether you are installing on a
Linux or Mac/OSX system:

```
sh ./vadr-install.sh linux
```

OR

```
sh ./vadr-install.sh macosx
```
The `linux` or `macosx` argument controls (only) the type of infernal
and blast executable files that will be installed.

The `vadr-install.sh` command will create several directories in the
current directory.  It will download and install VADR and the required
module libraries [sequip](https://github.com/nawrockie/sequip),
[Bio-Easel](https://github.com/nawrockie/Bio-Easel), as well as the
binary executables of [Infernal](http://eddylab.org/infernal/), the src
distribution of [HMMER](http://hmmer.org), and the
NCBI BLAST package (for either Linux or Mac/OSX).

The installation requires that you have the perl Inline module
installed on your system. If not, the installation script may
fail. If this happens, read [this](#inline).

When `vadr-install.sh` is finished running it will print important
instructions to the screen that explain how to modify your environment
variables so that you can run the VADR scripts, as discussed next.

---
### <a name="inline"></a> If installation or `do-install-tests-local.sh` fails because the `Inline` or `LWP` perl modules are not installed...

The perl `Inline::C`, `LWP::Simple` and `LWP::Protocol::https` modules
must be installed prior to installation. ([This
page](https://www.perl.com/article/1/2013/3/24/3-quick-ways-to-find-out-the-version-number-of-an-installed-Perl-module-from-the-terminal/)
lists three ways to check if a perl module is installed.)

You can install these modules using `cpan` with these commands:

`cpan install Inline::C`

`cpan install LWP::Simple`

`cpan install LWP::Protocol::https`

However, for Mac/OSX these commands may not work if you have
not installed the "Command line tools for Xcode" or "XCode" packages.
You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store for free.

It is possible that you have `Inline` installed but not for `C`, if this is the case, you *might* see an error message like this:
```
 Error. You have specified 'C' as an Inline programming language.

I currently only know about the following languages:

    Foo, foo
```

If this is the case, try installing `Inline::C` with this command:

`cpan install Inline::C`

---

## Setting VADR environment variables <a name="environment"></a>

As mentioned above, when you run `vadr-install.sh`, instructions will be
output about how to change your environment variables so that you can
run the VADR scripts. Those instructions are also included below for
reference, but without the actual path to where you ran `vadr-install.sh`
(below it is replaced with `<full path to directory in which you ran
vadr-install.sh>`)

---

### Instructions for setting environment variables output by `vadr-install.sh`

```
********************************************************
The final step is to update your environment variables.
(See https://github.com/ncbi/vadr/blob/1.1/documentation/install.md for more information.)

If you are using the bash or zsh shell (zsh is default in MacOS/X as
of v10.15 (Catalina)), add the following lines to the end of your
'.bashrc' or '.zshrc' file in your home directory:

export VADRINSTALLDIR=<full path to directory in which you ran vadr-install.sh>
export VADRSCRIPTSDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/vadr"
export VADRMODELDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/vadr-models"
export VADRINFERNALDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/infernal/binaries"
export VADREASELDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/infernal/binaries"
export VADRHMMERDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/hmmer/binaries"
export VADRBIOEASELDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/Bio-Easel"
export VADRSEQUIPDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/sequip"
export VADRBLASTDIR="$VADRINSTALLDIR/ncbi-blast/bin"
export PERL5LIB="$VADRSCRIPTSDIR":"$VADRSEQUIPDIR":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/lib":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/arch":"$PERL5LIB"
export PATH="$VADRSCRIPTSDIR":"$PATH"

After adding the export lines to your .bashrc or .zshrc file, source that file
to update your current environment with the command:

source ~/.bashrc

OR

source ~/.zshrc

---
If you are using the C shell, add the following
lines to the end of your '.cshrc' file in your home
directory:

setenv VADRINSTALLDIR "<full path to directory in which you ran vadr-install.sh>"
setenv VADRSCRIPTSDIR "$VADRINSTALLDIR/vadr"
setenv VADRMODELDIR "$VADRINSTALLDIR/vadr-models"
setenv VADRINFERNALDIR "$VADRINSTALLDIR/infernal/binaries"
setenv VADRHMMERDIR "$VADRHMMERDIR/hmmer/binaries"
setenv VADREASELDIR "$VADRINSTALLDIR/infernal/binaries"
setenv VADRBIOEASELDIR "$VADRINSTALLDIR/Bio-Easel"
setenv VADRSEQUIPDIR "$VADRINSTALLDIR/sequip"
setenv VADRBLASTDIR "$VADRINSTALLDIR/ncbi-blast/bin"
setenv PERL5LIB "$VADRSCRIPTSDIR":"$VADRSEQUIPDIR":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/lib":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/arch":"$PERL5LIB"
setenv PATH "$VADRSCRIPTSDIR":"$PATH"

After adding the setenv lines to your .cshrc file, source that file
to update your current environment with the command:

source ~/.cshrc

(To determine which shell you use, type: 'echo $SHELL')


********************************************************
```
---

### If you get an error about `PERL5LIB` being undefined...

If you use bash or zsh, change the PERL5LIB line in your `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.zshrc` file to:

```
export PERL5LIB="$VADRSCRIPTSDIR":"$VADRSEQUIPDIR":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/lib":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/arch"
````

or if you use C shell, change the PERL5LIB line in your `~/.cshrc`
file to:

```
setenv PERL5LIB "$VADRSCRIPTSDIR":"$VADRSEQUIPDIR":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/lib":"$VADRBIOEASELDIR/blib/arch"
```

And then execute `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`, or `source ~/.cshrc` again.

---
## Verifying successful installation with test runs<a name="tests"></a>

The VADR package includes some tests you can run to make sure that
your installation was successful and that your environment variables
are set-up correctly. 

These are several shell scripts for running tests; with respect to the
installation directory they are in the directory `vadr/testfiles/` and
start with `do-` and end with `.sh`.

At a minimum, you should run the 
`vadr/testfiles/do-install-tests-local.sh` script to make sure VADR installed
correctly. They should pass, as shown below.

The script `vadr/testfiles/do-all-tests.sh` will run all tests, but be
warned that script may take up to an hour or so to run. All the tests
should pass.

There is also special test script `do-install-tests-parallel.sh` that you
should run if you want to test if you can use the `-p` option to
`v-annotate.pl` for parallelization on a cluster.  But this test will
likely only work internally at NCBI or if you happen to have a compute
farm set-up in a similar way at NCBI. See this
[example](annotate.md#exampleparallel) for more information.
`do-install-tests-parallel.sh` is **not** run as part of `do-all-tests.sh`.

To run all tests, execute:

```
$VADRSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/do-all-tests.sh
```

To run only the `do-install-tests-local.sh` script, execute:

```
$VADRSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/do-install-tests-local.sh
```

This scripts can take up to several minutes to run. 
If something goes wrong, the script will likely exit quickly.

If the script fails immediately with a warning like:

`Can't locate LWP/Simple.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
LWP::Simple module)`

Or something similar but with `Inline` instead of `LWP`, then you will
need to install the perl `LWP` and/or `Inline` modules as described
[here.](#inline)

Below is an example of the expected output for
`do-install-tests-local.sh`:

The most important line is the final line:

```
Success: all tests passed
```

This means that the test has passed. You should see similar 
lines if you run the other tests. If you do not and need help
figuring out why, email me at eric.nawrocki@nih.gov.
